<h1> COP3530 Project 3 - Food Finder</h1>
Food Finder is a program that lists recipes based on what ingredients you have and what ingredients you can't use, say if you have an allergy. It uses three methods to sort the recipes: recipe with the least amount of ingredients, recipe with the least amount of steps, and recipe with the highest percent of ingredients chosen. Each of those methods were sorted by both Shell Sort and Radix Sort, allowing their effeciencies to be compared.
Whenever a blacklisted ingredient is chosen, no recipe with that ingredient will be recommended.
